### Hi there!

My name is Yoshiharu Yamashita, Yoshi for short.

I am originally from Japan but in 2001 I made one of the biggest decisions in my life and came to the UK to do a university degree course.

Being so far from home was not easy to begin with but life in the UK has turned out to be better than I could ever have imagined when I made that decision.

I am currently based in Cardiff, UK.

### Coder

I code for a living and for fun.

### Potter

When I am not coding, you can find me quite literally getting my hands dirty creating pots in my small home studio.

### Haruyama

Haru = spring season
Yama = mountain

In creating this website, I hope to showcase my work and also to share some of my experiences in pottery.
