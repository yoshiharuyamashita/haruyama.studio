To make pottery accessible to all. That is the mission statement of [Cardiff Pottery Workshops](http://www.cardiffpotteryworkshops.com/), where [I experienced wheel thrown pottery for the first time]({{< ref "/blog/2021-01-23-how-i-got-into-pottery" >}}).

### What I learned

My tutor was Kelly, one of the directors.

During my [6 week wheel throwing course](http://www.cardiffpotteryworkshops.com/throwing), I learned a lot under her guidance, including but not limited to

how to...

- store, parepare and wedge clay
- throw a cylindrical pot, a bowl and a lidded pot
- trim a pot
- attach a handle to a leatherhard pot
- apply glazes to a pot
- clean up your mess!

(Also I was lucky enough to experience a Raku firing session along with BBQ :yum:)

After becoming a member I refined what I had learned and acquired more knowledge and experience, for example throwing off the hump.

### A foundation to build upon

The six week beginner's course was pack full of useful information.

It gave me a foundation, skills and resources that enabled me to start investigating pottery on my own. As a member of the studio, help was always at hand when needed.

### What Kelly used to say

Of all the things Kelly taught us, one that had the biggest impact on me was:

> Don't get too attached to the objects you create. Focus on learning to perform each process correctly.

When learning to throw as a complete beginner, I found it was very easy to build up unnecessary tensions or frustrations not only physically but mentally.

I felt frustrated for making mistakes and for not being able to produce pots like the next person. Mistakes often come with an emotion of inadequacy.

What Kelly emphasised allowed me to focus on what was most important - not the objects but the process. Mistakes became merely unwanted results. They even turned into something positive - opportunities to correct those unwanted results.

### When we are safe to go out again

If you are curious about pottery or thinking of trying something new, why not give pottery a go? It may well become your lifelong passion :fire:

Thanks to Cardiff Pottery Workshops for making pottery accessible to all!
