The ceramic work explores everyday and interior forms, from functional
objects to pieces that quietly hold space within a room.

Each piece begins on the wheel through a repeated sequence of
deliberate movements. While the process remains consistent, the
conditions are never exactly the same — the clay, the pace of the
wheel, and the pressure of the hand subtly shift each time.

Rather than correcting every variation, certain moments are noticed
and allowed to remain. When an unexpected change in form or surface
continues to feel right over time, it is carried through the rest of
the making and becomes part of the finished piece.

The work embodies 静 (*sei*, stillness) and 動 (*dō*, movement) —
at times holding one, at times the other, and sometimes allowing both
to exist within a single form.

Made by hand in small batches in Wales, the work balances intention
with chance, resulting in objects that are similar in spirit but
distinct in character.

Each object carries the trace of a particular moment in the making.
