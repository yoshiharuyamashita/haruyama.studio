I am going to do my best to [keep a kiln firing log](https://alongthelanes.com/2019/11/26/keeping-a-kiln-log-free-template/).

My kiln is a 13amp plug in top loader called [Little Chief](https://northernkilns.com/plug-in-kilns/). You may find this post useful if you are considering buying the same kiln.

- Stoneware glazes used:
  - [Reactive White](https://www.hot-clay.com/vitraglaze-stoneware-glaze-toasty-brown-5347.html) on inside
  - [Rusty Mottle](https://www.hot-clay.com/vitraglaze-stoneware-glaze-rusty-mottle-5343.html) on outside (8 cups)
  - [Burnt Olive](https://www.hot-clay.com/vitraglaze-stoneware-glaze-burnt-olive-5332.html) on outside (4 cups)
  - [Oxide Green](https://www.hot-clay.com/vitraglaze-stoneware-glaze-oxide-green-5371.html) on outside (12 cups)
- Buff stoneware clay from [Commercial Clay](http://www.commercialclay.co.uk/)
- VitraClay [White Throwing Clay](https://www.hot-clay.com/vitraclay-premium-white-throwing-clay-high-fire.html)
- Programme = [Normal speed (high)]({{< ref "/blog/2021/stoneware-glaze-firings/index.md#-normal-speed-high" >}})
- Most pots bubbled :sob: (MUST try [Normal speed (mid)]({{< ref "/blog/2021/stoneware-glaze-firings/index.md#-normal-speed-mid" >}}) next)
- [Rusty Mottle](https://www.hot-clay.com/vitraglaze-stoneware-glaze-rusty-mottle-5343.html) produced the most consistent results (even with different clay types)
- [Burnt Olive](https://www.hot-clay.com/vitraglaze-stoneware-glaze-burnt-olive-5332.html) on [White Throwing Clay](https://www.hot-clay.com/vitraclay-premium-white-throwing-clay-high-fire.html) could potentially be one of my favourites
