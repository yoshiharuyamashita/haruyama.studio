I have always loved crafts.

In fact, that is one of the reasons why I enjoy writing software - I view it as a craft which requires a lot of care and attention.

### The sense of touch

Unlike other crafts, however, what I create is not perceptible by touch - you produce beautifully written code, you see it working (or crashing :scream:) and deploy it somewhere for it to do something useful.

Unfortunately you cannot pick it up in your hands and go...

> Oh yes, it has a nice weight to it!

During or after working on major software projects, I often feel I wish I had something tactile to show for. This feeling has always been a slight frustration for me in my career.

A few years ago, I decided to do something about it.

I initially tried leathercraft. I made a few items like a pen case (which I still use) or a key cover but my passion withered away after a few months.

### Software to tableware

It was at [a craft fair](https://www.craftfestival.co.uk/Cardiff) when I first came across [Cardiff Pottery Workshops](http://www.cardiffpotteryworkshops.com/).

In order to find out what pottery was really like, I enrolled on one of their six week wheel throwing courses and glad I did.

I vividly remember coming home feeling exhausted but in a very satisfying way after my first lesson. I was not sure the last time I concentrated that intensely!

Before too long I knew pottery, in particular throwing on the wheel, was something I wanted to get better at.

I became a member at Cardiff Pottery Workshops so that I could practise more frequently. It was the summer of 2018.

### Ikigai?

For me it was the fact that software products are not tangible that I met pottery in the end.

Maybe pottery has become my [ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai) :thinking:

How did you get into pottery?

I would be interested to hear your story!
