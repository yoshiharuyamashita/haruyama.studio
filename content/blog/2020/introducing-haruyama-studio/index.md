Hello world!

A few days ago, I set a goal to create a website showcasing my work before 2020 ends.

Well, here it is!

Mind you, I don't have my glazed pieces to show yet but I'm working on it :grin:

In the meantime, here is a couple of old photos:

{{< /figure >}}

{{< figure class="figure" figcaption="Seven yunomis freshly turned" >}}
  {{< img src="20210110_165216.jpg" alt="Seven yunomis" >}}
{{< /figure >}}

Watch this space :boom:
