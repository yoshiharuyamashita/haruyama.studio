### Meet Yoshi

I am originally from Japan. In 2001 I made one of the biggest decisions in my life and came to England to do a university degree course.

Being so far from home was not easy to begin with but life in the UK has turned out to be better than I could ever have imagined when I made that decision.

I found ceramics after moving to Cardiff. My new love of pottery steered my focus back to my Japanese culture and rekindled a strong sense of pride in the quality and skill of Japanese craftsmanship.

Since I set up my home pottery studio in 2020, I have been crafting pots under the brand name Haruyama Studio. **Haru** (春) and **Yama** (山) are Japanese words that mean "spring season" and "mountain" respectively.

In creating this website, I hope to showcase my work and also to share some of my experiences in pottery.
