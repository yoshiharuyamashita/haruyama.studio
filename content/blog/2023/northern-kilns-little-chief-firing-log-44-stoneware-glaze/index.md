- Favourite 1 = Turquoise x Black plant conver
- Favourite 2 = Turquoise x Scandi ichirinzashi vase
- Favourite 3 = Almond Milk x Scandi ichirinzashi vase
- Glaze with Turquoise first and then Almond Milk on top produced nice result on black clay (also experiment with Almond Milk first and then Turquoise on top)
- Slip on black clay (one plant pot and vase) -> not so keen :unamused:
- Turquoise didn't quite work on some pots (perhaps I didn't apply it evenly or thickly enough) :confused:
