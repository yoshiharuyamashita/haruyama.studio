Hi there!

My name is Yoshiharu Yamashita, Yoshi for short.

I am originally from Japan but in 2001 I made one of the biggest decisions in my life and came to England to do a university degree course.

Being so far from home was not easy to begin with but life in England has turned out to be better than I could ever have imagined when I made that decision.

I am currently living and working in Cardiff, Wales.

When I am not coding, you can find me getting my hands dirty creating pots in my small home studio.

This site is where I plan to post articles and thoughts on anything pottery related and also showcase what I create.
