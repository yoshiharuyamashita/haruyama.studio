I am going to do my best to keep a kiln firing log from now on.

My kiln is a 13amp plug in top loader called [Little Chief](https://northernkilns.com/plug-in-kilns/).

- 1 tall vase, 1 small vase and 6 yunomis
- Programme = slow more cautious stoneware firing
- Tall vase had chipped foot ring due to glaze contacting kiln shelf
- Also glaze bubbled (brushed too thick or dust on the pot?)
- Be very careful when getting glaze off shelves!

- 33 yunomis
- Programme = slow more cautious stoneware firing
- Tried [Albany Slip Brown](https://www.bluematchbox.co.uk/amaco-potters-choice-albany-slip-brown.html) and [Vert Lustre](https://www.bluematchbox.co.uk/amaco-potters-choice-vert-lustre.html) (preferred)
- 3 coats inside and outside
- Brushing Albany over Vert produced good effect but not so the other way round

- 5 tall vases and 33 yunomis
- Programme = normal bisque firing
