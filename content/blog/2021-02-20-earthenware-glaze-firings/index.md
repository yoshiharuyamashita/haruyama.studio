Below is a record of earthenware glaze firing schedules I have used with my electric kiln.

My kiln controller splits the firing into segements. They consist of

- a heating ramp (&deg;C/h)
- a target temperature (&deg;C)
- a soak period (h.mm)

### :fire: Normal speed low temperature

|                 | Segment 1 | Segment 2 | Segment 3 |     |
|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Ramp (&deg;C/h) | 120       | 150       | 80        | End |
| Temp (&deg;C)   | 700       | 950       | 1020      |     |
| Soak (h.mm)     | 0.00      | 0.00      | 0.20      |     |

Notes:

- Leave bung in from start to finish
- Open kiln when temperature is below 50&deg;C
- Using a soak to achieve a 'greener' firing option in which energy and wear and tear on the kiln is less
