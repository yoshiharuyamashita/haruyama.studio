As 2025 comes to a close, I’ve been spending time with my work — not by making new pieces, but by looking again at where I am and how I work.

I rarely know what I’m making at the outset. I begin with a set of conditions, try something, and pay attention to what holds. Some attempts don’t go anywhere. Others begin to suggest a direction.

What I value is that moment when something unclear starts to take shape — not because it was planned, but because it emerges through attention and repetition.

Over the past weeks, updating my website felt like part of that same process. A chance to pause, reflect, and make space for what comes next.

I’m entering the new year without a fixed image of where the work will go, but with a clearer sense of how I want to arrive there.
