Each spiral is determined by the speed of the wheel, pressure applied from the inside and the thickness of the faceted walls. For me the finished result conjures nostalgic imagery from the Izu coastline where I grew up, both from the ocean itself and the rippling effect the ocean leaves behind on the sand.
