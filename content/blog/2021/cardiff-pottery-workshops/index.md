### To make pottery accessible to all

That is the mission statement of [Cardiff Pottery Workshops](http://www.cardiffpotteryworkshops.com/).

I am one of their many students who [experienced wheel thrown pottery for the first time]({{< ref "/blog/2021/how-i-got-into-pottery" >}}).

My teacher was Kelly, one of the directors of Cardiff Pottery Workshops.

### Learning outcomes

During my [6 week wheel throwing course](http://www.cardiffpotteryworkshops.com/throwing), I learned a lot under her guidance, including but not limited to how to...

- store, parepare and wedge clay
- throw a cylindrical pot, a bowl and a lidded pot
- trim a pot
- attach a handle to a leatherhard pot
- glaze a pot
- clean up after your mess :wink:

### A foundation to build upon

The six week beginner's course was packed full of useful information and gave me a foundation, skills and resources that enabled me to start investigating pottery on my own.

After becoming a member I refined what I had learned and continued acquiring more knowledge and experience, for example skills for...

- throwing off the hump
- throwing large pieces
- throwing thinly or deliberately thickly
- throwing many cups with the same width and height
- making tools (wooden throwing ribs, chucks, etc)
- reclaiming clay

Help was always at hand when needed.

### Kelly's wisdom

Of all the things she taught us, one that had the biggest influence on me was:

> Don't get too attached to the objects you create. Focus on learning to perform each process correctly.

Initially I did not quite get the first bit.

When learning to throw as a complete beginner, it was very easy for me to build up unnecessary tensions or frustrations not only physically but mentally (often without realising).

I felt frustrated for making mistakes and for not being able to produce pots like the next person.

Eventually I understood what she was saying. I realised that what I created after each throwing attempt did not matter that much at this early stage of learning. What mattered was to learn each step well.

### Mistakes

Mistakes often come with a feeling of inadequacy but pottery has taught me to treat them as opportunities for improvement - each mistake has its cause and by investigating and fixing it you get better at something.

Thanks to Cardiff Pottery Workshops for making me wiser. :thumbsup:
