- Black plant pot with Almond Milk (left) => will do this again :thumbsup:
- Black plant pot with Turquoise (middle) => colour didn't show up well :unamused:
- Black plant pot with Turquoise then Almond Milk on top (right) => some cracks around rim caused by glaze crawling perhaps :thumbsdown:
- Both cups are nice, especially the spotty one (left) :thumbsup:
- Grey plant pot with Turquoise => too heavy :unamused:
