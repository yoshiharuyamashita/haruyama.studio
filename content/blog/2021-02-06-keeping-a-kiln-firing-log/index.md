I am going to do my best to [keep a kiln firing log](https://alongthelanes.com/2019/11/26/keeping-a-kiln-log-free-template/).

My kiln is a 13amp plug in top loader called [Little Chief](https://northernkilns.com/plug-in-kilns/). You may find this post useful if you are considering buying the same kiln.

- 1 tall vase, 1 small vase and 6 yunomis (1 kiln shelf)
- Tall vase had chipped foot ring due to glaze contacting kiln shelf
- Also glaze bubbled (brushed too thick or dust on the pot?)
- Be very careful when getting glaze off shelves!
- Programme = [Slow more cautious stoneware firing]({{< ref "/blog/2021-02-07-firing-schedules-with-northern-kilns-little-chief/index.md#-slow-more-cautious-stoneware-firing" >}})

- 33 yunomis (3 kiln shelves)
- Tried [Albany Slip Brown](https://www.bluematchbox.co.uk/amaco-potters-choice-albany-slip-brown.html) and [Vert Lustre](https://www.bluematchbox.co.uk/amaco-potters-choice-vert-lustre.html) (preferred)
- 3 coats inside and outside
- Brushing Albany over Vert produced good effect but not so the other way round
