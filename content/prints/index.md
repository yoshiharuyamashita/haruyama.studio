description: "Code-generated prints exploring variation, balance, and chance, with each work selected from a space of unrepeatable outcomes."
---

Through the interaction of systems and chance, compositions emerge.

The works are generated through code‑based processes that introduce
variation — shifts in colour, form, density and balance — within a
set of chosen conditions.

While each execution produces a different outcome, the parameters
are carefully guided and adjusted, allowing intention and
unpredictability to coexist.

From these outcomes, a single composition is selected and fixed
as a print.

Installed within everyday environments, each work offers a visually
engaging presence — encountered differently as light, mood and
attention shift.

Each print is a single selection from a space of unrepeatable outcomes.
