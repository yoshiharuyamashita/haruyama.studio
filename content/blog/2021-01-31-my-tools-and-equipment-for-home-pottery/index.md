I started to do pottery at home in October 2019. Since then I have been slowly building up my collection of tools and equipment. In this post I would like to share some of my most frequently used ones.

For information about where to buy pottery tools and equipment (mainly in the UK) please check out my [previous post]({{< ref "/blog/2021-01-30-a-list-of-pottery-suppliers" >}}). :thumbsup:

### Potter's wheel

{{< img src="20210131_100410.jpg" alt="Potter's wheel" >}}

A [Shimpo RK-3D](https://www1.ceramics.nidec-shimpo.com/en_GB/shimpo-rk-3d/) was the first major item I bought when I had decided to do pottery at home. It has been my potter's wheel of choice. It can handle a large lump of clay. It is very quiet. It just works! I use two bricks to raise my feet so that both of my knees are parallel to the floor.

Bought from [Bath Potters Supplies](https://www.bathpotters.co.uk/shimpo-whisper-rk3d-wheel)

### Electric kiln

My kiln [Little Chief](https://northernkilns.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/LITTLE-CHIEF.pdf) arrived in December 2020. It was a huge decision whether or not to buy a kiln and took ages to work out which one to go for! I am glad I settled for this British made beauty. The kiln plugs into a standard domestic socket without the need for specialist wiring.

### Work table

I built this multipurpose work table with help from my first pottery teacher Kelly ([Cardiff Pottery Workshops](http://www.cardiffpotteryworkshops.com/)). I wedge clay, reclaim clay and glaze pots on it. It is also handy to be able to store heavy and bulky items such as bags of clay and kiln shelves underneath.

Yes, that table top needs replacing. :neutral_face:

### Throwing tools

{{< img src="20210131_143524.jpg" alt="Throwing tools" >}}

Throwing is what I enjoy most. Some of the tools shown here were handmade by me, for example the centre one, which has two tools in one.

### Turning tools

Nothing fancy but these two wooden tools have been enough to trim all my pots so far. I use the flat one for trimming chucks.

### Chucks

Chucks are useful when turning pots. I make various ones for pots with different shapes and sizes. I thrown them and leave them to dry for a week or so. I then trim them using the flat turning knife. All of my chucks are unfired.

### Glazing tools

As I am still new to glazing, these are all I have at the moment but my collection is expected to grow soon in this category.

### Miscellaneous

These tools don't get enough limelight like the ones above but I cannot do without them! The unsung heroes of pottery.

#### Adjustable stool

{{< img src="20210131_145047.jpg" alt="Adjustable stool" >}}

All four legs are adjustable. I tend to sit so my upper body leans forward slightly. This stool makes throwing even more enjoyable.

#### Flexi tub

{{< img src="20210131_144504.jpg" alt="Flexi tub" >}}

After each throwing session, I wash all my tools in this tub. It is also big enough to wash my wheel's splash pans.

Bought from [Wilko](https://www.wilko.com/en-uk/wilko-large-flexi-tub-39l/p/0312620)

#### Siphon pump

{{< img src="20210131_144329.jpg" alt="Siphon pump" >}}

I find dealing with clay water is one of the biggest headaches when doing pottery at home. What I have been doing is to leave the dirty water for a few hours and then use this pump to siphon out the clear water.

Bought from [Amazon UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Liquid-Fuel-Transfer-Siphon-Pump/dp/B06XKHP8Q4/ref=sr_1_6?dchild=1&keywords=siphon+pump&qid=1612035877&sr=8-6)

#### Clay sink

{{< img src="20210131_145325.jpg" alt="Clay sink" >}}

Reclaiming clay was a nightmare until I got this! It was pricey but has been extremely useful especially when dealing with very soft clay. You can also reverse it to wedge clay on, which is ingenious.
