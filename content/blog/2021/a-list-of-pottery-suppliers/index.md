Pottery requires a lot of materials, tools and equipment etc.

Fortunately there are a lot of suppliers out there but this also worked against me when I was starting out. Choosing where to source them took a very long time.

### Suppliers

Here is a list of suppliers (mainly UK based) I currently use, have used or have been mentioned by my fellow potter friends. I aim to update the list from time to time as I discover more suppliers.

### Starting small

I started buying a couple of items as and when I needed them. As my studio is small, this approach has worked very well for me.

You may not need to buy them. Chances are that you probably already own some pottery tools even if you have never done pottery before. For example, kitchen utensils, old credit cards, ice lolly sticks can all be used as your trusted tools!

### Happy potting!

I know the list above is small but I hope it is good enough to get you started with pottery quickly!

If you know of any other good suppliers please let me know.
